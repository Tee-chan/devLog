## Getting Started
Just run them one by one in your terminal:

1. Clone the repo
2. cp .env.example .env.local
3. npm install        ← prisma generate runs automatically
4. npm run setup      ← runs migrations
5. npm run dev

Or chain them all in one line so they run back to back automatically:

npm install && npm run setup && npm run dev
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
